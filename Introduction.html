                    Reverse the clock back to its 1980s, when the automobiles began to flood into the public's eyesight.
                    Various countries have their own localized corporations dedicated to automobiles manufacturing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Among those companies, it seems that those from <span id="red">Japan</span> turned out to be the one pick of worldwide consumers, in terms of its <em>high fuel efficiency</em> and <em>cost-performance ratio</em>.
                    This alerts the <span id="green">American government</span>, as more of their citizens began to purchase automobiles imported from <span id="red">Japan</span> instead of considering their local brands.
                    As a protection for its local manufacturer, the <span id="green">American government</span> requested a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/voluntary_export_restraint.asp"><strong>Voluntary Export Restraint</strong> (VER)</a> from those Japanese companies, which is nothing but rather reducing the number of exported autombiles from Japan.
                    These companies eventually reached a consensus and decide to decrease their export quantities as a result.

                It turns out that the <strong><span id="red">Japanese automobile companies</span></strong> seem to gain more benefits. Experts note that the following changes occured after the VER come to light:
                    <ul id="explanation2">
                        <li>One estimate asserts Japanese imported cars were about <span id="red">$2500 more expensive</span> in 1984 than they would have been without the VERS.</li>
                        <li>Higher prices of imported cars allowed American producers to sell their automobiles at about <span id="red">$1000 more</span> than they would have.</li>
                        <li>Due to these higher prices, the U.S. consumers paid about <span id="red">$10 billion more for Japanese cars</span> in 1985-86 than they would have otherwise, 
                            and this money has gone directly into the pockets of the Japanese automobile producers.</li>
                        <li>Much of the additional profits have been invested in increasing productive capabilities which allowed those companies to <span id="green">further reduce the cost 
                            of producing new cars</span> in subsequent years. </li>
                        <li>The VER did succed in saving American jobs, however, the cost per job saved was <span id="red">about $160,000 per year</span>.</li>
                    </ul>
