                    Let's start with the <span class="mark_red">simplest</span> case! Consider there is only one firm being capable of producing such chips in demand! Treat yourself as the head of the company and 
                    your staff all counts on you to give a number, telling them how many units of chips they should produce in next quarter of the year. Of course, you want to earn more profits.

                    Completing the square gives $$\pi=-q^2+15q=-(q-\dfrac{15}{2})^2+\dfrac{225}{4}, $$ which maximizes by \(q=\dfrac{15}{2}\) and the corresponding profit is \(\dfrac{225}{4}\) (\(=56.25\)).

                Now that you've figured out what to do when you're the only firm monopolizing the market. A natural question to ask is what happened when more competitors joined.
                Let us assume now that another firm cuts into your market and start selling chips of same qualities. How should you defend yourself in this competition?
                </p>

                <p>
                Denote your firm as Firm 1, with profit \(\pi_1\), your competitor's firm as Firm 2, with profit \(\pi_2\). Assume the outputs from Firm 1 and Firm 2 are \(q_1, q_2\) respectively.

                    Evidently, \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\) are both functions in terms of \(q_1\) and \(q_2\). Hence we may write notations like \(\pi_1(q_1, q_2)\) and \(\pi_2(q_1, q_2)\). 
                    Then, it is easy to see that $$\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = (20-q_1-q_2)q_1-2q_1=-q_1^2+(15-q_2)q_1$$ and $$\pi_2(q_1, q_2) = (20-q_1-q_2)q_2-2q_2=-q_2^2+(15-q_1)q_2.$$

                        Based on your previous analysis, we again see that the profit functions for both firms are of quadratic form. Moreover, we notice that \(\pi_1\) is maximized by \(\hat{q_1}=\dfrac{15-q_2}{2}\) and
                        \(\pi_2\) is maximizd by \(\hat{q_2}=\dfrac{15-q_1}{2}\). It is reasonable for us to call such \(\hat{q_1}\) and \(\hat{q_2}\) the "best responses" for Firm 1 and Firm 2 respectively, since such output level 
                        is sort of a "response" that maximizes one's profit given one's opponent's move. Naturally, we come up with the following plot.

                        <strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong> is a terminology in game theory that describes a circumstance 
                        where no one can gain anything by unilateral change. Hence, this circumstance is sort of balanced as to both players, 
                        since further making any changes in their moves doesn't really benefit them. Hence, it is often described as "solutions" to "games".

                Hence there is a special meaning about the <span class="mark_red">intersection point</span>, where both firms have their profits maximized at it. 
                It follows that no one can gain by unilateral change the output level. Therefore, we reach a <strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong> at the intersection.
                This means, if the other firm also has a smart mind like you, you and your opponent will likely to choose the output quantity corresponds to the intersection point!!! 
                We'll denote this special point from now on by \((q_1^e, q_2^e)\) (\(e\) refers to <strong>e</strong>quilibrium).

                    Note that \(\pi_1 + \pi_2 = 50 < \dfrac{225}{4} (=56.25)\). This means when the two firms merge into one firm, they behave worse than the scenario we've first discussed in the <span id="popboxtitle">Cournot Monopoly</span> section.

                <em>Why is that?</em> This is because of two firms are simultaneously striving for their own best interest. Hence they lost the grip of the bigger picture.
                What if these two firms cooperate with each other? Can they do a better job? 
                </p>

                <p>
                With cooperation, they will not only strive for their own best interest, but will work together (behave as a single firm) to achieve the best result and reasonably split their profits afterwards.
                Of course, by working together, here we mean that they together adjust their output level to maximize their total profits.

                It is reasonable to split the workload equally, i.e. two firms produce half of the optimal quantity. We'll call these quantities \(q_1^c, q_2^c\) respectively (\(c\) stands for cooperation). and hence they should also split the profits equally. We leave it for you to do this.

                            It may not be the case if we further allow price and cost of various other weird forms. But \(p(q)\) and \(c(q)\) of various forms also remains as a potential topic that you may want to explore.

                <p>Up until now, we've learnt a lot about Cournot Duopoly! Recall that
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two firms striving for their best interest without cooperation lead to a Nash Equilibrium (\((q_1^e, q_2^e) = (5, 5)\), with \((\pi_1, \pi_2) = (25, 25)\)).</li>
                        <li>Two firms can cooperate, which grants them higher profits (\((q_1^c, q_2^c) = (\dfrac{15}{4}, \dfrac{15}{4})\), with \((\pi_1, \pi_2) = (\dfrac{225}{8}, \dfrac{225}{8})\)).</li>
                        <li>One firm can cheat on the other, by providing them fake intention of cooperation. The cheater gets even higher payoff, and the one get cheated gets worse payoff than he's supposed to receive (\((q_1^b, q_2^c) = (\dfrac{45}{8}, \dfrac{15}{4})\), with \((\pi_1, \pi_2) = (\dfrac{2025}{64}, \dfrac{675}{32})\)).</li>

                <p>
                It seems that one of the case is missing, i.e., when both firms provide with each other a fake intention of cooperation and all decide to cheat the other. 
                We'll show that in this case, both players "reap what they've sown" and eventually hurt themselves. But before that, we invite you to try to explore yourself.

                    <em>Proof</em>. We first generalize the price function and the cost function by writing \(p(q) = D - q\) and \(c(q) = Cq\) for some constants \(C, D > 0 \) such that \(D > C\). 
                    Then $$\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = (D-q_1-q_2)q_1 - Cq_1 = -q_1^2 + (D-C-q_2)q_1.$$ Similarly, $$\pi_2(q_1, q_2) = (D-q_1-q_2)q_2 - Cq_2 = -q_2^2 + (D-C-q_1)q_2.$$ 
                    Hence $$\pi = \pi_1 + \pi_2 = -q_1^2 + (D-C-q_2)q_1 - q_2^2 + (D-C-q_1)q_2 = -(q_1+q_2)^2+(D-C)(q_1+q_2),$$ which maximizes by \(q_1+q_2 = \dfrac{D-C}{2}\). <br>
                    One checks that \(\{(\pi_1(q_1, q_2), \pi_2(q_1, q_2)): q_1 + q_2 = \dfrac{D-C}{2}, q_1, q_2 \ge 0\}\) forms the bargaining set of this game and the maximin point is \(0, 0\). 
                    Applying the Nash Arbitration Method gives \((\pi_1^c, \pi_2^c) = (\dfrac{11}{16}(D-C)^2, \dfrac{11}{16}(D-C)^2)\), obtained by \((q_1^c, q_2^c) = (\dfrac{D-C}{4}, \dfrac{D-C}{4})\). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    One checks that \(\pi_1(q_1, q_2^c) = -q_1^2 + \dfrac{3}{4}(D-C)q_1\), which maximizes by \(q_1^b = \dfrac{3}{8}(D-C)\). This then gives \(\pi_2(q_1^b, q_2^c) = \dfrac{3}{32}(D-C)^2\). 
                    One also checks that \(\pi_1(q_1^b, q_2^b) = \pi_2(q_1^b, q_2^b) = \dfrac{3}{32}(D-C)^2\). The equalities then arises naturally.

                            We further mention the existence of analysis on <span id="underline">Cournot Oligopoly</span> (i.e. more than 2 firms), but the analysis to be carried out will be of the similar taste as what we've done throughout the whole section except that 
                            you need to figure out how to handle the multiple variables. We recommend those who are intersted to start with the <em>symmetric Cournot Oligoply</em> where all firms' output level are the same, and proceed to other scenarios.

                <ul>
                    <li>Two firms striving for their best interest without cooperation lead to a Nash Equilibrium (\((q_1^e, q_2^e) = (5, 5)\), with \((\pi_1, \pi_2) = (25, 25)\)).</li>
                    <li>Two firms can have cooperation which can help them to achieve better result, yet there is also room for betrayal. We can formalize a \(2 \times 2\) payoff matrix 
                        that documents all possibilities (Cells corrected to 3 decimal places).
