                    Business competition is not that kind of trick that allows you to cheat on your opponent once and run away. 
                    Dishonesty can be either punished or tolerated by your opponent when the next competition arrives. Given that, 
                    you and your opponent will compete with each other for a looooooooong time, what can you say about your strategies?
                    Would you like to be <span class="green">honest and cooperative</span>? ... or, <span class="red">dishonest and deceptive</span>?

                    Spending a while on the above calculator, you may find that it is tricky to identify any valuable pattern or strategies.
                    This is reasonable, after all, when the game is repeated many times, the game itself is destined to be more difficult to analyze.

                <p>
                    However, the payoff matrix in the last section somewhat motivates us to conclude two profound strategies in one time Cournot Competition.
                </p>

                <p>
                <span class="green">Strategy I: Cooperate:</span> <br>
                With collusion, both firms will have an optimal amount to produce that will maximize their joint payoff. 
                To cooperate means to produce such amount of products.
                </p>

                <p>
                <span class="red">Strategy II: Cheat:</span> <br>
                As the cooperation is not stable, one can unilaterally maximize his payoff under the assumption that his opponent is cooperative.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <p>
                We once again turn to this familiar matrix. This time, we'll regard this competition as a two-person game where 
                both players have two strategies, <span class="green">cooperate (Producing \(q^c\))</span> or <span class="red">cheat (Producing \(q^b\))</span>
                </p>

                <table class="table">
                    <tr>
                        <th class="firm">Firm 1 \ Firm 2</th>
                        <th class="strategy">Cooperate (Produce 7)</th>
                        <th class="strategy">Betray (Produce 10.5)</th>

                        <th class="NE">\((98, 98)\)</th>
                        <th>\((110.25, 73.5)\)</th>

                        <th>\((73.5, 110.25)\)</th>
                        <th>\((73.5, 73.5)\)</th>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <span id="winered">The Tale of A Greedy World</span> told us that when both players simultaneously cheat on each other, they reap what they've sown.
                Hence, you may notice that no one wants to cheat on each other! It's better off cooperating with the other to earn more. In this case, the game is no longer interesting.

                <hr>

                <p>
                Hence, we impose two new assumptions into this scenario:
                </p>
                
                <div class="orderedlist">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Integral production quantity: Only integer \(q_i\) is allowed</li>
                        <li>Conservative convention: If two situations leads to the same payoff as for one player, then he'll choose the better one</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                These are reasonable assumptions as most of real-life problem only concerns with integral units of products and when it comes to business, 
                it is rare for one to being aggressive and do harm to his own payoff, respectively. Anyway, after imposing such two assumptions, the matrix then becomes:
                
                <p></p>

                <table class="table">
                    <tr>
                        <th class="firm">Firm 1 \ Firm 2</th>
                        <th class="strategy">Cooperate (Produce \(7\))</th>
                        <th class="strategy">Betray (Produce \(10\))</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th class="strategy">Cooperate (Produce \(7\))</th>
                        <th class="NE">\((98, 98)\)</th>
                        <th>\((110,77 )\)</th>

                </table>

                <p></p>

                We surprisingly find that this matrix now takes on the form of a <a id="PD" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Lo2fgxWHw">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>. 
                Try to compare the above matrix with the payoff matrix of Prisoner's Dilemma:

                    We state these notable strategies related to infinitely repeated Cournot Competition for you. To understand why they are famous, 
                    or in some sense "best" of all strategies, those who are intersted may further seek external materials for rigorous mathematical proof.

                    <span class="color1">Grim Trigger</span> <br>
                    Player starts by fully cooperating with his opponent. However, he never cooperates once he got betrayed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="color2">Carrot and Stick</span> <br>
                    Player starts by fully cooperating with his opponent. However, he will betray back for a fixed number of times, \(T\), if he once got betrayed. 
                    When the punishment ends, the player will continue to fully cooperate. When \(T=1\), this strategy is also as known as <span id="color3">tit-for-tat</span>.<br><br>
                    Definition of \(T\) can be extended to any positive number. For example, if \(T=\dfrac{1}{2}\), this means the player will punish once when he was betrayed twice.

                <p>
                <span class="color4">Aggressive Rate</span> <br>
                    Strategies like <span class="color1">Grim Trigger</span> and <span class="color2">Carrot and Stick</span> are rather a protective mechanism, 
                    however, if you don't cheat (being aggressive), we've seen that you cannot gain anymore than the mutual cooperation result. 
                    Therefore, if a player want to gain more, maybe he should cheat actively to attempt obtaining a higher payoff. <br>
                    We'll assume that a player will attack (to cheat) if his opponent cooperates in a row for \(A\) times, and this defines the aggresive rate.

                    For those who are interested, we'd like to introduce one more kind of strategy named <span class="color1">Zero-Determinant Strategy</span>.
                    One may seek the paper "Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent" by Press, W. H. and Dyson, F. J. for more theoretical details.

                <p>
                    Long story short, zero-determinant strategies is a kind of strategy applied to all games <em>taking the form of Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma</em> 
                    that forces linear relationship between two players' payoff. Surprisingly, as the thesis points out:

                <p>This kind of strategy takes a special form, as it is based on the outcome of the previous round. We'll state the optimal strategies and final payoff without proof. First thing first, for an Iterated Prisonners' Dilemma, we have such a payoff matrix:</p>

                    <tr>
                        <th class="firm">Player 1 \ Player 2</th>

                        <th>\((P,P)\)</th>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p></p>
                where \(T>R>P>S\).

                <p>We know
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        There are four possible outcomes in each round, i.e. \((cc, cd, dc, dd)\), where the first literal refers to the strategy Player I adopted, and the second literal refers to the strategy of Player II.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        A strategy of a player is the probability vector \(\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)\) indicating the probability of the player to cooperate given the corresponding outcome of the last round.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        We write \(\mathbf{S}_x=(R,S,T,P)\) and \(\mathbf{S}_y=(R,T,S,P)\), the payoff vector for both players.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Let \(\chi > 0 \) be the <span id="color2">extortionate factor</span>.
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then a zero-determinant strategy with extortionate factor \(\chi\) is just 
                    $$\tilde{\mathbf{p}}=\phi\left[(\mathbf{S}_x-P\mathbf{1})-\chi\left(\mathbf{S}_y-P\mathbf{1}\right)\right]$$
                    where \(0 \le \phi \le \dfrac{P-S}{(P-S)+\chi(T-P)}\) (WLOG, we shall assume \(\phi\) to be the midpoint among this interval throughout the later discussion).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also, it can be shown that under this strategy, the payoff for both players are
                    $$s_x=\dfrac{P(T-R)+\chi\left[R(T-S)-P(T-R)\right]}{(T-R)+\chi(R-S)}$$ and
                    $$s_y=\dfrac{\chi P(R-S)+\left[R(T-P)-S(R-P)\right]}{(T-R)+\chi(R-S)}$$ 
                    where \(s_x\) is the payoff of the player using zero-determinant strategy, and \(s_y\) is the payoff of his opponent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are rather abstract symbols that is not intuitive at all. To sum up, these figures and symbols basically tell us:

                    <ul>   
                        <li>
                            The higher \(\chi\) is, the higher \(s_x\) and the lower \(s_y\) it is.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although it is true that the higher the extortionate factor \(\chi\) is, the higher the payoff \(s_x\) is, it can be shown that if 
                            \(\chi \to \infty\), then \(s_y\) will be sufficiently close to the mutual defection value, leaving him no incentive to cooperate.

                            Therefore, there is a lot of flexibility on this extortionate factor \(\chi\).

                    Note that we have 
                    $$\lim_{\chi\to\infty} s_x = \dfrac{R(T-S)-P(T-R)}{R-S} = \left(\dfrac{R-P}{R-S}\right)T-\dfrac{R}{R-S}(P-S) < T$$
                    and
                    $$\lim_{\chi\to\infty} s_y = \dfrac{P(R-S)}{R-S} = P.$$
                    Therefore, we see that extortionate profit cannot exceed a fixed number smaller than \(T\), while the player being extortioned still can guarantee the mutual defection value, \(P\).

                    Despite that we won't prove all these results, but the extortionate factor itself is already interesting enough to explore. Try to freely alter the extortionate factor, 
                    take a look at both players' payoffs.

                    After traversing all that about the Cournot Competition, backtracking to the very beginning, we're sure that you've already got some clues 
                    why the protection scheme imposed by American government actually benefits the Japanese automobiles companies. This is also why the 
                    World Trade Organization (WTO) <span id="color1">called it an end on Volutnary Export Restraints (VER) in 1994</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cournot Competition is actually a kind of competition based on homogenous products' competition, this does not only apply to the commercial field, all these techniques
                    you've learnt can also be used on modelling real-life scenarios. We encourage you to model similar scenarios as we've done, into a iterated Prisoners' Dilemma, this not only 
                    reduces the difficulty of analyzing such games, but also more intuitive and realistic.
